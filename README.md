# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Data we need to track

  -- solution
    -- 5 letter string, e.g. 'drain'
  -- past guesses
    -- an array of past guesses
    -- each past guess is an array of letter objects [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
    -- each object represents a letter in the guess word {letter: 'a', color: 'yellow'}
  -- current guess
    -- string 'hello'
  -- keypad letters
    -- array of letter objects [{key: 'a', color: 'green'}, {}, {} ...]
  -- number of turns
    -- an integer 0 - 6

### Game process

  -- entering words:
    -- user enters a letter & a square is filled with that letter
    -- when a user hits delete it deletes the previous letter
    -- when a user hits enter it submits the word
      -- if all squares are not filled with letters then the word is not submitted
      -- if that word has already been used in a prev guess then the word is not submitted
  -- checking submitted words:
    -- each letter is checked to see if it matches to the solution
    -- each letter is assigned a color based on it's inclusion in the solution
      -- exact matches (correct position in the solution) are green
      -- partial matches (in the solution but not the correct position) are yellow
      -- none-matches (not in the solution at all) are grey
    -- the guess is added the grid with the correct colors
    -- the current guess moves to the next row
    -- the keypad letters are updated (colors)
  -- ending the game:
    -- when the guessed word fully matches the solution
      -- modal to say 'well done'
    -- when the user runs out of guesses
      -- modal to say 'unlucky'
